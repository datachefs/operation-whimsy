<h1>Setting up a simple web server on your laptop</h1>
<p>￼ a lot of simple webpages can be run straight in your laptop without any extras: just open them up using your browser. But if you need, for example, to load a file, you will often need a web server.</p>
<p>But you don't need anything fancy; it's not like you're running an actual web server that lots of people are going to visit. So, what's the easiest way to do it?</p>
<p>If you use visual studio code, here's what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Visual Studio Code And Install the Live Server extension from the Extensions marketplace.</li>
<li>Open the directory you want to serve.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <code>index.html</code> (or any HTML file) and select <code>Open with Live Server</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will start a server and open your default browser to view your page.
