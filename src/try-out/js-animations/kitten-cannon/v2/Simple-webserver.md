# Setting up a simple web server on your laptop 

￼ a lot of simple webpages can be run straight in your laptop without any extras: just open them up using your browser. But if you need, for example, to load a file, you will often need a web server. 

But you don't need anything fancy; it's not like you're running an actual web server that lots of people are going to visit. So, what's the easiest way to do it?

If you use visual studio code, here's what you do:

1. Open Visual Studio Code And Install the Live Server extension from the Extensions marketplace.
3. Open the directory you want to serve.
4. Right-click on the `index.html` (or any HTML file) and select `Open with Live Server`.

This will start a server and open your default browser to view your page.
